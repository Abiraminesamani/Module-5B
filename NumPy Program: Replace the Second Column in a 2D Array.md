# NumPy Program: Replace the Second Column in a 2D Array

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a **NumPy** program that deletes the second column from a given 2D array and inserts a new column at the same position.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. **Import NumPy**: Start by importing the NumPy library.
2. **Get Input**: Get a 2D NumPy array and a new column (as another array) from the user.
3. **Delete Column**: Use `np.delete()` to remove the second column (index 1) from the original array.
4. **Insert Column**: Use `np.insert()` to insert the new column at the second column's original position.
5. **Display Result**: Print the updated array with the replaced column.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                [4, 5, 6],
                [7, 8, 9]])
new_col = np.array([10, 11, 12])
arr_deleted = np.delete(arr, 1, axis=1)
arr_updated = np.insert(arr_deleted, 1, new_col, axis=1)
print(arr_updated)

```

## Result
Thus, To write a **NumPy** program that deletes the second column from a given 2D array and inserts a new column at the same position verified and executed successfully.
